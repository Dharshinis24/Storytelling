<br><br>As they turned to leave, the unexpected happened. A silent alarm was triggered. They only had seconds before the entire museum was flooded with guards. Marcus cursed under his breath, but there was no time to dwell on it.

    Marcus, Jack, and Carla moved swiftly through the museum’s labyrinthine corridors, dodging guards and slipping through shadows. Just as they reached the exit, they were met with a group of guards blocking their path.
    
    <br><br>Jack charged forward, taking down the guards with brute force while Marcus and Carla made a dash for the getaway car waiting outside. Lisa had the car running, ready to speed off the moment they jumped in.</p></td>
