<h1 style="text-align: center;">Part 4: The Getaway</h1>
<p>With the guards closing in, Marcus and Carla made a break for the museum's rear exit. Jack had bought them a few precious seconds, but they could hear the footsteps of more guards echoing through the halls. Bursting through the doors, they sprinted to the waiting getaway car where Lisa had the engine revving.
<br><br> Just as they jumped in, the guards emerged from the museum, guns drawn. Lisa floored the gas pedal, and the car screeched away, speeding through the city streets with the police in hot pursuit. Marcus glanced back, clutching the Night's Eye, its blue light shining brightly in the darkness.</p>
<p>The chase was intense. Lisa weaved through traffic, taking sharp turns to throw off their pursuers. Helicopters whirred overhead, and police cars surrounded them from all sides. It seemed like there was no way out.

<br><br>But Marcus had planned for this. "Head to the docks!" he shouted. Lisa swerved toward the water, racing down the narrow, winding roads. As they neared the docks, Marcus activated a remote detonator. A series of explosions erupted on a nearby bridge, creating a fiery distraction that blocked the police's path.
    
<br><br>With the police diverted, Lisa sped into an old, hidden warehouse by the docks. The crew quickly transferred into a boat, their final escape route. As they sailed away into the night, the sound of sirens faded into the distance, leaving only the quiet lapping of water against the boat.
    
<br>They had done it. The Night's Eye was theirs.
<br><br>And that's the end of "The Midnight Heist"! I hope you enjoyed the story and the images.
