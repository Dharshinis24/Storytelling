<h1 style="text-align: center;">Part 1: The Plan</h1>
<p>In the bustling city of Metropolis, under the cover of night, a notorious thief named Marcus was planning his most ambitious heist yet. Known for his cunning and stealth, Marcus had set his sights on the city’s most guarded treasure: a priceless diamond known as "The Night's Eye." Stored in the heavily fortified Metropolitan Museum, it was said to be impossible to steal. But Marcus loved a challenge.</p>
<p>For weeks, Marcus studied the museum’s security system. Every camera angle, every guard shift, every sensor—he knew them all. But to pull off this heist, he needed a team.<br>He gathered his crew in a dimly lit, abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the city. There was Lisa, the tech genius who could hack into any system; Jack, the muscle who could take down any obstacle in their way; and Carla, the master of disguise who could slip in and out unnoticed.</p>

<td><p>Marcus laid out the blueprint of the museum on a dusty table. “We hit at midnight,” he said. “Lisa, you’ll disable the cameras. Jack, you take out the guards silently. Carla, you’ll be our eyes and ears inside. We have exactly ten minutes to get in and out. No mistakes.”
